## To be done
How to expire a nft automatically?

{
    When a customer purchases a product the retailer will upload the metadata to IPFS using pinata api's.
    SafeMint a NFT and pass the tokenURI to the safemint function.
    Metadata includes owner's account address, warranty period or warranty expiry.

    If someone wants to resell the product then he must get all the data from metadata and create new metadata with a different owner then mint a new NFT with different tokenURI. And delete the old metadata.
}


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
